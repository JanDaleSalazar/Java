 * The task is to take in a credit card number, and find out if it is a valid credit card number or not. Credit card numbers follow an algorithm called "Luhn's algorithm". 
The formula verifies a number against its check digit, which is the last digit. This number must pass the following test:
From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, double the value of every second digit. If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or, alternatively, the same result can be found by subtracting 9 from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
Take the sum of all the digits.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
Assume an example of an account number "7992739871" that will have a check digit added, making it of the form 7992739871x. The sum of all the digits, processed as per steps 1 and 2, is 67+x. Thus x must be 3 to bring the total to be modulo 10 = 0. If x is not 3, then this is not a valid credit card number.
